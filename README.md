# Codsoft

During my internship at CodSoft, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects that allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in data science. Throughout the internship, I utilized various Python libraries and machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. The projects I worked on were Titanic Survival Prediction, Iris Flower Classification, and Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The goal of this project was to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. I used the following steps to accomplish this: Handled missing values, Converted categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding, Standardized the data, Used libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of passenger demographics and survival rates, Created visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between features and the target variable,
Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Evaluated model accuracy using cross-validation and confusion matrices.
2. Iris Flower Classification
In this classic machine learning project, I classified Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions using the Iris dataset.
Used Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn for visualizing the relationships between different features.
Plotted pairwise relationships and histograms to understand the data distribution, Applied different classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project involved detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions.
Performed feature scaling to normalize the data.
Visualized the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Selected relevant features for the model to improve performance and reduce overfitting, Trained models using Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Algorithms: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook for coding and visualization

Learning Outcomes

Gained practical experience in data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
Enhanced my skills in building and evaluating machine learning models.
Learned how to handle imbalanced datasets and improve model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Developed the ability to interpret model results and visualize data effectively.
Overall, my internship at CodSoft was a valuable experience that significantly improved my data science skills and prepared me for future challenges in the field.
